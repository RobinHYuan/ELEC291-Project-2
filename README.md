# ELEC291 Project 2

------------

### Introduction:
For this project, we will design, build, program, and test a microcontroller-frequencymeter metal detector. The metal detector I am building for this
project relies on the inductance change that occurs when metal is placed close to a wire coil. If this inductor is part of an oscillator circuit, such change will produce a frequency variation. By measuring that frequency variation, it is possible to determine the type of metal that is near the sensor coil.

### Update History:
**2021-04-03; 15:10:12; Saturday**
- The system can now play any given wav file that is 8-bit, 22050Hz, monotone and samller than 4MB
- A  header file is created to store all functions; the makefile is also modified to cope with the changes

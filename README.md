# ELEC291 Project 2

------------

### Introduction:
For this project, we will design, build, program, and test a microcontroller-frequencymeter metal detector. The metal detector we are building for this
project relies on the inductance change that occurs when metal is placed close to a wire coil. If this inductor is part of an oscillator circuit, such change will produce a frequency variation. By measuring that frequency variation, it is possible to determine the type of metal that is near the sensor coil.

### Features List:

Our design incorporates many extra features in addition to the required ones. Inductances of given inductors and capacitances of given capacitors can be measured, temperature/humidity can be measured, an IR control system allows for remote controlling, and the soldering onto the prototype board allows for a more robust and portable design. Two displays are used. The 16x2 LCD will display some data and the next step to be executed by the operator; the 16x4 LCD, which uses a different instruction set, will display the menu and the current task that the microcontroller is working on, indicated by an arrow. The menu is rather user-friendly since the operator can choose to use either an IR-controller or the onboard pushbuttons to control the system. You can use either of them to cycle through the main menu or enter a function that contains multiple steps. Our system also has an auto-backlighting circuit so that users can interact with the system with ease in a dark environment

# ELEC291 Project 2

------------

### Introduction:
For this project, we will design, build, program, and test a microcontroller-frequencymeter metal detector. The metal detector I am building for this
project relies on the inductance change that occurs when metal is placed close to a wire coil. If this inductor is part of an oscillator circuit, such change will produce a frequency variation. By measuring that frequency variation, it is possible to determine the type of metal that is near the sensor coil.

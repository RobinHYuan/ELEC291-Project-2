# ELEC291 Project 2

------------

### Introduction:
For this project, we will design, build, program, and test a microcontroller-frequencymeter metal detector. The metal detector I am building for this
project relies on the inductance change that occurs when metal is placed close to a wire coil. If this inductor is part of an oscillator circuit, such change will produce a frequency variation. By measuring that frequency variation, it is possible to determine the type of metal that is near the sensor coil.

### Update History:
**2021-04-03; 15:10:12; Saturday**
- The system can now play any given wav file that is 8-bit, 22050Hz, monotone and samller than 4MB
- A  header file is created to store all functions; the makefile is also modified to cope with the changes

**2021-04-04; 02:31:23; Sunday**
- Frequency detector circuit works

### NOTE:
So far, I found out that the following pins seem vacant:\
RB2, RB3, RA2, RA3, RB4, RA4 || RB15, RB13, RB12, RB10\
(I think RB6 is used for the period functions after reading thru it so I excluded it from the list)
